How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Because bugs are usually generated when things are changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can always go back to a version where there is no error or to reuse an old code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: the commits would be more meaningful
    Cons: sometimes would forget to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    This is because systems like Google Docs mostly deal with files that are not inter-related some systems like Git deal with files that are inter-related.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log: view the amendments made previously
    git diff: compare two commits noted in git log

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I can always go back to the point where the break hasn't happened.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For version control!
